# Julekalender

This is based on Kodegenets [skaperkalender](https://kodegenet.no/projects/task/skaperkalender) - but with a bit more random behaviour thrown in :)

Mostly working. Only got one motor direction working - it was working both ways but for some reason if I set inA to high now it just whines instead of spinning.
